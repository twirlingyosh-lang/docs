<Tip>
  **Your app, your address.** Use `yourapp.com` instead of the default `created.app` URL.
</Tip>

## What you need

- Anything Pro or Max subscription ([upgrade here](https://anything.com/pricing))
- An app ready to publish

That's it.

## Two ways to do this

### 1. Buy through Anything (easiest)

We'll buy and set up the domain for you. Zero DNS configuration on your end.

**Here's how:**

1. Open your project and hit Publish
2. Click "Get a custom domain"
3. Search for the domain you want
4. Buy it

Done. We handle everything else through our partnership with [Name.com](https://www.name.com/support). Payment pulls from your Anything payment method.

DNS typically resolves in under 24 hours.

### 2. Bring your own domain

Already own a domain? Connect it to your app. You'll need to add some DNS records at your provider (instructions below).

<Note>
  **Heads up:** DNS changes can take up to 48 hours. During this time your domain might not work or show old content. If it's still broken after 48 hours, email us.
</Note>

## How domains work

When someone visits your domain, three things happen:

<Steps>
  <Step title="DNS Lookup">
    Your domain provider checks its records
  </Step>
  <Step title="Routing">
    Those records point to Anything's servers
  </Step>
  <Step title="Delivery">
    We route visitors to your app
  </Step>
</Steps>

Think of DNS records as an address book for the internet.

## Connect an existing domain

<Steps>
  <Step title="Step 1: Open your project, click Publish">
    Open your project and click Publish
  </Step>
  <Step title="Step 2: Click 'Get a custom domain'">
    Click "Get a custom domain"
  </Step>
  <Step title="Step 3: Select 'Connect your domain' and enter it">
    Select "Connect your domain" and enter it (like `www.yourdomain.com`)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Step 4: Add DNS records at your domain provider">
    Add these DNS records at your domain provider:

    ```
    Type: A
    Name: @
    Value: 76.76.21.21
    ```

    ```
    Type: CNAME
    Name: www
    Value: cname.vercel-dns.com
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
  **Using a subdomain?** (like `app.yourdomain.com`)

  Just add one record:

  ```
  Type: A
  Name: your-subdomain (e.g., "app")
  Value: 76.76.21.21
  ```
</Note>
