## Overview

In this training session, Derek builds Pilot Pulse - a platform for flight instructors and students. Watch how for how to solve responsiveness, pages vs. components, and storing data + users. 


## Key Concepts

Watch the video to learn about the following concepts:

*   **Components vs. Pages:** The differences and when to use each for optimal organization and routing.
*   **Component Creation:** Best practices for making, updating, and passing data between components.
*   **Responsiveness:** Designing for different screen sizes and handling layout issues.
*   **Chat Prompts:** How to effectively communicate instructions using Anything's chat interface.
*   **Chat Scope:** Understanding the context of the chat within your project (page, component, or global).
*   **Linking & Navigation:** Different methods for linking pages and components, and managing app navigation.
*   **Routes:** How to setup page routes for web navigation, and when to avoid them.
*   **User Accounts:** Using Anything's built-in user accounts system and the data it provides.
*   **Functions:** Creating custom functions to connect with external APIs and extend Anything's functionality.
*   **Testing Functions:** Validating custom functions using Anything's test runner.
*   **Data Handling:** Managing data flow and transferring data between different parts of the app.
*   **Debugging:** Leveraging Anything's AI to help pinpoint and fix errors in your code.
*  **Iterations:** How to build iteratively and make good decisions for the project.
*   **Scope:** How to manage code as a project gets larger.
*   **Built in User Management:** How Anything has built in user management, and no need to configure firebase.
