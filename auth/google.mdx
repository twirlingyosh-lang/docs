title: "Google Sign In"
description: "Let users sign in to your app with their Google account"
---

Let users sign in to your app with their Google accounts. They'll share their email, name, profile picture, and language settings.

<Warning>
  **Google Auth is not yet available for mobile apps.** We are working on this feature. Currently, Google Sign In only works for web apps published to custom domains.
</Warning>

You'll need to set up a few things in Google first, then add those settings to Anything.

## Before You Start

Make sure you have:

<Check>
  An Anything project with [User Accounts](/builder/user-accounts) turned on
</Check>

<Check>
  Your app running on a custom domain through [Anything's domain setup](/publish-and-share/custom-domains)
</Check>

<Warning>
  Google Sign In needs a custom domain - you can't use the default `created.app` domains. You'll need:
  - A domain you own
  - [Anything Pro subscription](https://create.xyz/pricing)
  - DNS records properly configured
</Warning>

## Troubleshooting

<Accordion title="Can't see the Google button">
  - Check if User Accounts is turned on
  - Make sure Google Sign In is enabled in Project Settings
  - Try publishing your changes again
  - Clear your browser data and try in incognito mode
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Getting 'Access Blocked: This app's request is not valid'">
  <img src="/images/auth/google/error-requestinvalid.png" style={{ borderRadius: '0.5rem' }} />
  <img src="/images/auth/google/error-requestinvaliddetails.png" style={{ borderRadius: '0.5rem' }} />
  - Check that your Client ID and Client Secret are correctly pasted in Anything
  - Ensure your domain is added as an Authorized JavaScript Origin in Google Cloud
  - Verify your app is published and accessible at your custom domain
  <Tip>
    In Google Cloud, always use 'https://www.your-domain.com' not just 'your-domain.com'. Many login problems happen because people forget the 'https://' protocol and 'www' prefix.
  </Tip>

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Login not working">
  - Double check your domain is exactly the same in Anything and Google Cloud
  - Make sure your callback URL is right: `https://www.[your-domain].com/api/auth/callback/google`

  - Email address
  - Name

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I use Google Auth for internal tools and permissioning?">
  Yes! Configure your app as "Internal" in Google Cloud Console to unlock enterprise features:

  - **Skip verification** - No Google app review required
